# RoonVis

**A native tvOS (Apple TV 4K) music visualizer.** RoonVis renders Milkdrop presets with
[libprojectM](https://github.com/projectM-visualizer/projectm) — via [ANGLE](https://github.com/google/angle)
(OpenGL ES 3.0 → Metal) — reacting in real time to audio streamed from **Roon** over **Snapcast**.
It works end-to-end on real hardware.

<!-- TODO: screenshot / gif here -->

> ⚠️ **Tested only on Apple TV 4K (3rd gen), tvOS.** Other Apple TV models are **untested and
> unsupported** — RoonVis may work on them, but it's not recommended, purely due to lack of testing.
> All the performance tuning (1080p, mesh size, latency) was measured on the A15.

## What it does

Roon plays music → a Raspberry Pi captures it into a virtual audio cable and streams it with Snapcast
→ the Apple TV app receives the live audio and drives projectM, which renders reactive Milkdrop
visuals to your TV.

## Getting started (quick)

Full guide: **[Getting Started](../../wiki/Getting-Started)**. The short version:

1. **Set up the Pi.** On a Raspberry Pi (64-bit Raspberry Pi OS), run:
   ```sh
   sudo bash scripts/pi-setup.sh
   ```
   It installs RoonBridge + Snapcast and configures the snd-aloop loopback automatically.
   → [Setup: Roon / Pi / Snapcast](../../wiki/Setup-Roon-Pi-Snapcast)
2. **Finish in Roon** (the script prints these): authorize RoonBridge; enable the loopback as an
   audio zone and **group it with your speakers**; set that zone's **sample-rate conversion to
   44.1 kHz in Roon's DSP engine (MUSE)**. → [Setup details](../../wiki/Setup-Roon-Pi-Snapcast)
3. **Install the app** — sideload the release `.ipa` with **AltStore** or **Sideloadly** (re-sign
   with *your* Apple ID), **or** build from source (see [Build & Run](../../wiki/Build-and-Run)).
4. **Point it at your Pi** — set `SnapcastServerHost` (the Pi's IP) in `Info.plist` / build config.

## Configuration & recommended settings

Before building, set these for your environment:

| What | Where | Set to |
|---|---|---|
| Apple Developer Team ID | CMake `-DROONVIS_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM=...` | your Team ID (free Personal Team is fine) |
| Snapcast server host | `Info.plist` → `SnapcastServerHost` | your Pi's IP |

**Recommended in-app settings** (also the shipped defaults): audio-sync **delay 270 ms**
(+ **270 ms** on the Roon audio output), render **1080p**, warp **mesh 96×72**.
